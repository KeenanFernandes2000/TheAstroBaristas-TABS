            This beautiful coffee story was started by 3 friends who have all
            connected on one single emotion, and that emotion is coffee, our
            name the Astro baristas also has a meaning to it where the word
            baristas is inspired from our love for and to deliver coffee and the
            word Astro comes from a class we all met in and that is where the
            bean of Astro baristas was planted, and from then on we were
            committed to crafting the finest quality coffee,and stay tuned in
            the future for our signature blends and coffee beans from parts of
            the world of your choice.
